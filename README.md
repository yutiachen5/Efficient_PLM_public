# Efficient_PLM_public

**Optimizing Protein Language Modeling via Constrained Learning**  
*Masterâ€™s Project â€” Duke Biostatistics Program (2023â€“2025)*

This project explores efficient pretraining of protein language models (PLMs) by actively identifying and sampling the most informative sequences. Our goal is to improve performance while reducing computational cost.

ðŸš§ This repository is under active development!  
ðŸ“„ A preprint on this work will be published soon!!
