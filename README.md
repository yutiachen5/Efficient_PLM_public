# Efficient_PLM_public

**Optimizing Protein Language Modeling via Constrained Learning**  
*Master’s Project — Duke Biostatistics Program (2023–2025)*

This project explores efficient pretraining of protein language models (PLMs) by actively identifying and sampling the most informative sequences. Our goal is to improve downstream performance while reducing computational cost.

🚧 *This repository is under active development.*  
📄 *A preprint describing this work will be published soon!*
